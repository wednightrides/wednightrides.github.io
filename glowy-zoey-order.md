One of our favorite bike accessories are party lights. They're super visible (providing great visibility from the side, too, which headlights and taillights don't always), and super fun, and in my experience they make people treat you more kindly as a cyclist because they're so joyful. Regular rider Daniel P suggested we do a party lights group buy in preparation for the darker months of the year, and we're giving it a shot! We're planning a "Light Up the Night" themed ride on Nov 13, the first ride after Daylight Savings Time ends, and coming up in December there's the Bicycle Coalition's annual Holiday Lights Ride - so now's a great time to get your bike lit up.

We've had good luck with a brand called [Glowy Zoey](https://glowyzoey.com/products/led-bicycle-wheel-lights-waterproof), several of us on the Wednesday crew use them. The lights are in a waterproof tube that you thread through your spokes near the rim and secure with small zip ties. The battery pack attaches to your hub with zip ties, and the USB rechargeable core slides out easily for recharging. The lights display in different colors and patterns - solid, flashing, or shifting multi-color. They weigh 100g per wheel. They cost $30 for a pair, and Glowy Zoey will give us a discount of 15% off ($25.50/pair) if we order 20+ sets , or 20% off ($24/pair) if we order 50+ sets. We get no kickbacks and this isn't a fundraiser, just a straight group buy. Update: we've already had more than 20 orders, so these will be discounted to at least $25.50 per set, possibly further.

A note on sizing: while the [Glowy Zoey product page](https://glowyzoey.com/products/led-bicycle-wheel-lights-waterproof) states the lights fit up to 26" wheels, I and other folks have put these on larger, standard wheel sizes (in my case, both 650b and 700c) with no issues and they fit well, go the whole way around. I've also put them on kids wheels (16" and 20").
