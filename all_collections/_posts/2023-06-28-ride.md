For this week's ride, our first ride of summer, we'll be touring community gardens (including [Emily St](https://www.ngtrust.org/growing-home/) & [Iglesias Gardens](https://iglesiasgardens.com/)), and murals about food and water justice (like [this one on Bodine High School](https://www.muralarts.org/artworks/reading-the-flow-and-chainlinkgreen/)) in South & North Philly. Our ride leader Melissa is dedicating this ride to her late uncle, who recently passed away from pancreatic cancer. We'll end at Love City, where they're offering happy hour prices for those who wish to [donate to Melissa's cancer research fundraiser](https://profile.pmc.org/MS0448).

A few notes, complementary to our [How We Ride](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/) guide:

* Stay behind the leader of the ride.

* This route includes a few intersections where crossing traffic doesn't have a stop sign (e.g. on Emily and Manton St). Use extra care at those intersections, and look -- don't assume that because the rider in front of you continued, it's safe to do so

* If you ride with your phone or bike computer mounted on the bike, please [pin or download the route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/43430306) ahead of time and run it in navigation during the ride. The more people who know where we're going, the better!
