We’re thrilled to kick off Bike Month with a joint ride with [Indego](https://www.rideindego.com/)! Indego is celebrating its 10th anniversary of providing bike share in Philadelphia. Launched in 2015, Indego has powered over 8 million rides and continues to expand into new neighborhoods. We’ll be welcoming dozens of Indego riders to this ride--if you’re an Indego member, feel free to join in! As always, all bikes are welcome. 

No registration is needed for this ride if you’re riding your own bike. If you or a friend need a bike, [register at Indego’s web site](https://www.rideindego.com/event/10thbday-ride/) to use an Indego e-bike for FREE! 

This ride starts and ends at the Art Museum steps. Here are a few places nearby to hang out with your fellow riders after the ride:

* [Parks on Tap, Schuylkill River Park](https://www.parksontap.com/locations-1/schuylkillriverpark), [300 S 25th St.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8XCPNduHrehyChhq5)
* [Bonner’s Irish Pub](https://www.bonnersirishpub.com/), [120 S 23rd St.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yRBjt2vyeK3Bjz1a6)
* [Cherry St Tavern](https://www.instagram.com/cherrysttavern/), [129 N 22nd St.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rPBzBfqjNbKwT7Yx8)
* [Urban Saloon](https://www.instagram.com/urbansaloon/?hl=en), [2120 Fairmount Ave.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L4tpJ5sLe7LhvthD7)


Please take the time to read our [How We Ride guide](/how-we-ride) for our ride practices. Here are a few that are especially important to keep everyone safe:

* **We stop at red lights.** This may be different from other group rides you've been on; it's important to not expect other riders or a ride marshal to hold traffic at intersections. Hanging out at a red light is a great chance to talk with your friends, make new ones, or just look around at the city.
* **We ride for fun.** While encountering nasty drivers is often unavoidable, our practice is to avoid conflict as much as possible. When there's potential for conflict, please pull over to the side to let cars go instead of engaging in confrontation with drivers.
* **Support your fellow riders.** If you see a fellow rider in need of assistance of any kind (mechanical, flat tire, physical injury, etc), please do offer support. However, if it’s clear that person is already getting the support they need, we encourage you to keep moving. In many situations, having an unnecessarily large group of people standing around on the street, curb, or sidewalk can be a nuisance and potentially dangerous to other people on the street or sidewalk.
* **Encourage one another!** For some, this will be the longest bike ride they've ever done. Give words of encouragement, offer to ride with someone if you think that might help.
* **Ride safely on hills.** If you need to walk your bike up a hill, that's ok! Please just move to the right as much as possible. Going downhill can also be dangerous! Brake gently as you go downhill to manage your speed and ride straight and predictably since others might be zooming past you.
* **Brings lights.** After dark, PA law requires all bikes to have a headlight and a red tail light or reflector.


Finally, a reminder of risks and responsibilities. You don’t need to sign a waiver to join a Wednesday Night Ride, because it’s an entirely voluntary & free group activity. But please keep in mind:

* Everyone rides at their own risk.
* Every rider is responsible for themselves, their behavior, and their bike.
* Keep your bike properly maintained. Here’s a link to a [basic bike check](https://bikepgh.org/2017/03/09/bike-video-abc-quick-check/).
* Cycling has inherent risks–you could crash, fall down, or get hit by a car, and get hurt or even killed–though we try to minimize these risks.
* If you have a health condition that could affect your ride or put you at additional risk, consider a) checking in with a doctor, b) letting us or a friend know, c) having a backup plan to get home if riding doesn’t work out.
* We always plan to have a sweeper, but can’t rule out that you could get lost, or that your bike could break down and you’ll need to find another way home.

**Want to lead a ride in 2025?** We're looking for ride leaders for May, June, July (and later in the year, too). Let us know if you're interested! Our only criteria for leading a ride is that you've joined us before. You don't need to have prior group ride lead experience or come up with the whole route on your own, we can help with that!

Thanks for riding! See you Wednesday.
