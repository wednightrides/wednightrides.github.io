Long-time rider and volunteer Karen Yee will be leading us from Race Street Pier, down the Delaware River Trail through to South Philly, hitting up some of the highlights of the upcoming [Holiday Lights Ride](https://bicyclecoalition.org/events/holiday-lights-ride-2023/). This week’s ride ends at a South Philly favorite, Cartesian Brewing on East Passyunk. 

If you’ve never been on one of our rides or want a refresher on our ride practices, please read our [How We Ride guide](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/). Specifically, we’d like to call attention to a couple of practices that are really important to how we do our rides to keep us all safe:
 
* Stop at red lights. This may be different from other group rides you have been on in the past—please DO NOT hold car traffic at intersections against the traffic light. If there’s a red light, we stop. Stick with a group big enough to hold the lane, and make friends while waiting for a green light. To avoid anxiety about getting separated, it’s helpful to have as many people as possible using turn-by-turn navigation with RideWithGPS or Komoot.
* Roll past conflict. Sadly, it’s almost inevitable we’ll encounter drivers who are unhappy their commute is interrupted by 30 seconds as a result of our ride. Do what makes sense to avoid and reduce conflict by pulling over, consolidating the group, or whatever makes sense in the situation. Do not swarm, block, or trap cars. Do not engage with aggressive car drivers.

With respect to inclimate weather, our practice is not to make a call on cancellations due to poor weather until the day-of to give Mother Nature every possible opportunity to change her mind. We'll cancel any ride by 3pm that day and send out notifications on our usual communication platforms (Instagram, Reddit, email, web). 

Thanks for riding! Feel free to invite a friend and we’ll see you Wednesday!
