This week, long-time rider and first-time leader Drew takes us on a ride passing all the named squares in Center City and South Philadelphia, including Franklin, Independence, Washington, Jefferson, Dickinson, Mifflin, Columbus, Wharton, Naval, Fitler, Rittenhouse, and Logan. How is that even possible? And only 9 miles. We'll end at Cherry Street Tavern - CASH only at the bar, please. 

Please check out our [How We Ride guide](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/) so we keep each other safe! If you're not up for the winter ride, it's always cool to meet the group at the bar, too.

Specifically, we’d like to call attention to a couple of practices that are really important to how we do our rides to keep us all safe:
 
* Stop at red lights. This may be different from other group rides you have been on in the past—please DO NOT hold car traffic at intersections against the traffic light. If there’s a red light, we stop. Stick with a group big enough to hold the lane, and make friends while waiting for a green light. To avoid anxiety about getting separated, it’s helpful to have as many people as possible using turn-by-turn navigation with RideWithGPS or Komoot.
* Roll past conflict. Sadly, it’s almost inevitable we’ll encounter drivers who are unhappy their commute is interrupted by 30 seconds as a result of our ride. Do what makes sense to avoid and reduce conflict by pulling over, consolidating the group, or whatever makes sense in the situation. Do not swarm, block, or trap cars. Do not engage with aggressive car drivers.

The forecast is looking dry and not too cold for tomorrow -- we hope to see you!
