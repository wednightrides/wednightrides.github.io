First-time ride leader @davekazzz takes us on a spin on one of his favorite loops in the city, which features Belmont Plateau’s epic skyline views! See you Wednesday!

Our post-ride destination is Bonner's Irish Pub on Sansom St and S 23rd St

A few notes, complementary to our [How We Ride](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/) guide:

* Stay behind the leader of the ride.
* **Do not block intersections with stop lights**, It's OK for our group to get broken up at lights, in fact necessary as our ride grows in size. Stick with a group big enough to hold the lane, and make friends while waiting for a green light.
* Don’t forget your lights! Sadly, the days are getting shorter and our rides now start after sunset.
* Hill alert: there are a few along the route. There's no shame in walking up your bike, but if you need to, please stay as far to the right as possible if you walk up the hill. 

A note on navigation: We recently started providing a .gpx file download link and a Komoot link. Komoot is a free app that offers turn-by-turn navigation without requiring a paid subscription. Having more people on our ride using the turn-by-turn navigation helps everyone stay on the correct route, so if you’re able to do so using Komoot, RideWithGPS, or another app/device you prefer, we’d appreciate the help!

With respect to inclimate weather, our practice is not to make a call on cancellations due to poor weather until the day-of to give Mother Nature every possible opportunity to change her mind. We'll cancel any ride by 3pm that day and send out notifications on our usual communication platforms (Instagram, Reddit, email, web). 

Thanks for riding! Feel free to invite a friend and we’ll see you Wednesday!
