This Wednesday, long-time rider and teacher Miriam will lead us on a route showcasing several of Philly's great schools. We'll start at Marconi Plaza, cross the Schuylkill twice, and end in Northern Liberties at Urban Village. 

**Ride leaders wanted!** We're seeking ride leaders for open dates in Aug, Sep, Oct, and Nov. Anyone can lead a great ride, you don't need to be an "avid cyclist", we'll help you with route planning. Email us at info (at) wednightrides.org if you're interested! Please have joined us at least once before, so you know how we ride.

A few notes, complementary to our [How We Ride](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/) guide:

* Stay behind the leader of the ride.
* If you ride with your phone or bike computer mounted on the bike, please [pin or download the route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/43802556) ahead of time and run it in navigation during the ride. The more people who know where we're going, the better!

Since it's thunderstorm season: our practice is not to make a call on the weather until day-of to give Mother Nature every possible opportunity to change her mind. We'll cancel any ride by 3pm that day.

Thanks for riding!
