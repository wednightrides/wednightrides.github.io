For our 100th ride, Dan of [The Trellis](https://www.thetrellisphilly.com/) will lead us on a lovely route touring the [Village Arts](https://www.barefootartists.org/village) installations by artist [Lily Yeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Yeh) in North Philly near Foterall Square and Ile Ife Park. We'll end at Love City Brewing, where the first Wednesday Night Rides ended 100 rides ago in June 2021. This is a shorter route, good for anyone including beginners or those new to group rides. Dan is also kindly printing a few hundred laminated WNR spoke cards for this ride, so come out and get one they're before gone.

Please take the time to read our [How We Ride guide](/how-we-ride) for our ride practices. Here are a few that are especially important to keep everyone safe:

* After dark, PA law requires a headlight and a red tail light or reflector on all bikes.
* Please use caution riding southbound on Franklin St - while it's a mellow, low-traffic street, opposing traffic does not have a stop sign at several intersections

Finally, a reminder of risks and responsibilities. You don’t need to sign a waiver to join Wednesday Night Rides, because it’s an entirely voluntary & free group activity. But please keep in mind:

* Everyone rides at their own risk.
* Every rider is responsible for themselves, their behavior, and their bike.
* Keep your bike properly maintained. Here’s a link to a [basic bike check](https://bikepgh.org/2017/03/09/bike-video-abc-quick-check/).
* Cycling has inherent risks–you could crash, fall down, or get hit by a car, and get hurt or even killed–though we try to minimize these risks.
* If you have a health condition that could affect your ride or put you at additional risk, consider a) checking in with a doctor, b) letting us or a friend know, c) having a backup plan to get home if riding doesn’t work out.
* We always plan to have a sweeper, but can’t rule out that you could get lost, or that your bike could break down and you’ll need to find another way home.

**Want to lead a ride in 2025?** We're looking for ride leaders for October, November, and later in the year. Let us know if you're interested! Our only criteria for leading a ride is that you've joined us before. You don't need to have prior group ride lead experience or come up with the whole route on your own, we can help with that!

Thanks for riding! See you Wednesday.
