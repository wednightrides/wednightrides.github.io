This week, Han will be leading us from the Eastern State Penitentiary (we're meeting on the Brown Street Lawn on the north side, not the main entrance on Fairmount) to Human Robot in Kensington. The route includes nice stretches of the SRT, Passyunk Ave, and the DRT. 

Important note: Human Robot is 21+ at the time we'll arrive at the brewery. If you're younger than 21 or are a parent and plan on riding with children, we'd love to have you join us for the ride but unfortunately, you'll have to make alternative post-ride plans. The vast majority of our rides and post-ride destinations are open to all ages, but occasionally, we'll pick a destination that has specific restrictions.

A few notes, complementary to our [How We Ride](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/) guide:

* Stay behind the leader of the ride.
* If you ride with your phone or bike computer mounted on the bike, please [pin or download the route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/44193058) ahead of time and run it in navigation during the ride. The more people who know where we're going, the better!

The forecast looks encouraging this week, but since it's thunderstorm season: our practice is not to make a call on weather until day-of to give Mother Nature every possible opportunity to change her mind. We'll cancel any ride by 3pm that day. It's gonna be a hot one though, so bring plenty of water and stay hydrated!

Thanks for riding!
