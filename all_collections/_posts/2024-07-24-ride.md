We want to express our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Dr. Barbara Friedes, [who was killed by a motorist last week](https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/bicyclist-killed-rittenhouse-square-identified-chop-doctor-barbara-friedes/) while she was riding her bicycle on Spruce Street. We support the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, 5th Square, and Philly Bike Action in demanding safer streets. Here are some links where you can learn how to get involved:

## Ride info

This week, we’re excited to have Rainey leading us through the heart of our beautiful city on a route that’s mostly familiar but ends at a neighborhood Irish pub in Fairmount that’s new to us, [The Black Taxi](http://theblacktaxi.com/). It’s been a month since our last ride and we’re looking forward to seeing familiar faces again. 

Wednesday Night Rides is a ride focused on experiencing joy and connection through a communal experience of riding bicycles. If you’re feeling unsure about being a part of a large social ride right now, we encourage you to take a break. Or if you might find comfort and healing in going on a ride, we’d love to see you on Wednesday. 

Even if you’ve been on a ride before, please take the time to read our [How We Ride guide](/how-we-ride). Please follow these ride norms so everyone's on the same page, and we keep the ride safe and fun. We'd like to highlight:

*Stop at lights*. Please, please DO NOT block intersections contrary to the traffic light. Our group can be very large and extended, and holding traffic risks serious conflict. If the light turns red, please stop.

*Roll past conflict*. Whether it's angry motorists or unruly pedestrians, please do not engage with conflict and move on in a way that de-escalates the situation.

Finally, a reminder of risks and responsibilities. You don’t need to sign a waiver to join a Wednesday Night Ride, because it’s an entirely voluntary & free group activity. But please keep in mind:

* Everyone rides at their own risk.
* Every rider is responsible for themselves, their behavior, and their bike.
* Keep your bike properly maintained. Here’s a link to a [basic bike check](https://bikepgh.org/2017/03/09/bike-video-abc-quick-check/).
* Cycling has inherent risks–you could crash, fall down, or get hit by a car, and get hurt or even killed–though we try to minimize these risks.
* If you have a health condition that could affect your ride or put you at additional risk, consider a) checking in with a doctor, b) letting us or a friend know, c) having a backup plan to get home if riding doesn’t work out.
* We always plan to have a sweeper, but can’t rule out that you could get lost, or that your bike could break down and you’ll need to find another way home.

Thanks for riding! See you Wednesday.
