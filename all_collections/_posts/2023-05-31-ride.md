On the last day of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we're lucky to have Sophia take us on an Asian Architects + Designers + Artists ride across our city.

Sophia has led this route before, and shared [a great write-up of the highlights](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1huPtAD-1a3EbjwaorHI3U77fyBk249DW-t8Ostj5uiY/edit) on the route (though unfortunately, we'll have to skip Shofuso as it's closed in the evenings).

We'll stop at Lloyd Hall to regroup (there's also a bathroom there), and we'll also stop at the 10th St Plaza at the entrance to Chinatown for Sophia to make a few remarks.
