The official 2026 holiday season starts this week... let's kick it off with a pre-Thanksgiving ride!

Longtime WNRider and fixie afficionado Justin D. will lead us from Rittenhouse Square to South Philly, then across town to Washington Pier, before rolling north to Fishtown to gather at Les & Doreen's Happy Tap, a popular neighborhood joint.

Please take the time to read our [How We Ride guide](/how-we-ride) for our ride practices. Here are a few that are especially important to keep everyone safe:

* We plan to regroup at Washington Pier
* After dark, PA law requires a headlight and a red tail light or reflector on all bikes.

Finally, a reminder of risks and responsibilities. You don’t need to sign a waiver to join Wednesday Night Rides, because it’s an entirely voluntary & free group activity. But please keep in mind:

* Everyone rides at their own risk.
* Every rider is responsible for themselves, their behavior, and their bike.
* Keep your bike properly maintained. Here’s a link to a [basic bike check](https://bikepgh.org/2017/03/09/bike-video-abc-quick-check/).
* Cycling has inherent risks–you could crash, fall down, or get hit by a car, and get hurt or even killed–though we try to minimize these risks.
* If you have a health condition that could affect your ride or put you at additional risk, consider a) checking in with a doctor, b) letting us or a friend know, c) having a backup plan to get home if riding doesn’t work out.
* We always plan to have a sweeper, but can’t rule out that you could get lost, or that your bike could break down and you’ll need to find another way home.

We're always looking for new folks to lead our rides! Our only criteria for leading a ride is that you've joined us before. You don't need to have prior group ride lead experience or come up with the whole route on your own, we can help with that!

Also, if you've been coming on these rides, we could always use more ride volunteers to help keep everyone safe. Please reach out at info at wednightrides dot org to let us know!

Thanks for riding! See you Wednesday.
