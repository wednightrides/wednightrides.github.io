Please join us this Wednesday to reject darkness and radiate light on our first ever LIGHT UP RIDE. It's our first ride after the end of Daylight Savings Time. Deck out yourselves and your bikes as brightly as you can and let's come together for a ride past a few notable Philly light displays, including [Addison Street](https://www.spottedbylocals.com/philadelphia/addison-street/), the [Percy Street Project](https://www.instagram.com/percystreetproject), and Cheesesteak Vegas. We'll start at Sister Cities Park at the AMOR sculpture and end at New Wave Cafe in Queen Village. This ride is inspired by [Bike JC's Light Up Rides](https://www.bikejc.org/light-up-rides).

Special ride notes:

* After dark, PA law requires all bikes to have a headlight and a red tail light or reflector. Need lights for the winter? Hit up your local bike shop.
* This time of year, people often ask: do you keep having these rides through the winter? The answer is yes!

As usual, we'll ride according to our [How We Ride guide](/how-we-ride). Please follow these ride norms so everyone's on the same page, and we keep the ride safe and fun. We'd like to highlight:

Stop at lights. Please, please DO NOT block intersections contrary to the traffic light. Our group can be very large and extended, and holding traffic risks serious conflict. If the light turns red, please stop.

Roll past conflict. Whether it's angry motorists or unruly pedestrians, please do not engage with conflict and move on in a way that de-escalates the situation.

Finally, a reminder of risks and responsibilities. You don’t need to sign a waiver to join a Wednesday Night Ride, because it’s an entirely voluntary & free group activity. But please keep in mind:

* Everyone rides at their own risk.
* Every rider is responsible for themselves, their behavior, and their bike.
* Keep your bike properly maintained. Here’s a link to a [basic bike check](https://bikepgh.org/2017/03/09/bike-video-abc-quick-check/).
* Cycling has inherent risks–you could crash, fall down, or get hit by a car, and get hurt or even killed–though we try to minimize these risks.
* If you have a health condition that could affect your ride or put you at additional risk, consider a) checking in with a doctor, b) letting us or a friend know, c) having a backup plan to get home if riding doesn’t work out.
* We always plan to have a sweeper, but can’t rule out that you could get lost, or that your bike could break down and you’ll need to find another way home.

We're always looking for new ride leaders, volunteers, and organizers. If you'd like to get more involved, drop us a DM! 

Thanks for riding! See you Wednesday.
