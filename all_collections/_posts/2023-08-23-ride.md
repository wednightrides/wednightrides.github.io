This week, long-time Wednesday-nighter Daniel P will lead us to the brand new K&T Trail in NE Philly, the newest addition to the [East Coast Greenway](https://www.greenway.org/) and [Circuit Trails](https://circuittrails.org/). The K&T trail is two miles of beauty along the Delaware River that looks and feels pretty spectacular at golden hour on a summer night. We'll double back so we'll get over 3 miles on the trail. Route highlights also include a new section of the DRT under 95, the Port Richmond Trail, and the little-known Adams Ave Connector. We'll end at Gaul & Co Malthouse, a church in Port Richmond that's been converted to a beer hall.

Please note this ride is longer than most at just under 15 miles. We'll regroup more frequently than usual on the ride to make sure we stay together and don't lose anyone, as this may be unfamiliar territory for many riders. Please check out our How We Ride guide if you haven't before. Bring lights - it will get dark as we ride.

A few notes, complementary to our [How We Ride](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/) guide:

* Stay behind the leader of the ride.
* If you ride with your phone or bike computer mounted on the bike, please [pin or download the route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/44110003) ahead of time and run it in navigation during the ride. The more people who know where we're going, the better!

The forecast (and air quality!) looks encouraging this week, but since it's thunderstorm season: our practice is not to make a call on weather until day-of to give Mother Nature every possible opportunity to change her mind. We'll cancel any ride by 3pm that day.

Thanks for riding!
