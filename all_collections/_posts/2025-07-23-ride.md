On next Wed Jul 23, we'll be reprising our [ride to the Wissahickon from July 2023](https://www.thetrellisphilly.com/wednesday-night-rides-goes-gravel/), this time partnering with PAPERtrail Bike Cafe's [Gravel Espresso ride](https://papertrailbikecafe.com/espresso-rides/). We'll ride from the [start at the Ellen Phillips Samuel Memorial](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1hi4r1KAM9Rwzc888) along Kelly Drive to the Wissahickon Trail and Forbidden Drive. At our midpoint on a bridge across the Wissahickon Creek, we'll meet up with Gravel Espresso riders, then return to PAPERtrail for post-ride espresso. Lastly, we'll roll to nearby Wissahickon Brewing as our final destination.

Forbidden Drive is unpaved, mostly crushed gravel but with chunkier sections. Many people find it rideable on tires with a width of 32c (1.25") or wider, typical on most hybrid, touring, mountain, and gravel bikes. It can be ridden with skinnier tires depending on your comfort level.

Please take the time to read our [How We Ride guide](/how-we-ride) for our ride practices. Here are a few that are especially important to keep everyone safe:

* Yield to and take caution near pedestrians and other trail users on the SRT, Wissahickon Trail and Forbidden Drive
* Bring a headlight! It's the law, and Forbidden Dr, Wissahickon Trail & parts of the SRT are unlit and get quite dark
* Our midpoint on Forbidden Drive is the stone bridge just before the Allens Lane Shelter. We'll re-gather there, take a group photo and hang out in nature for a few minutes
* There is a short, steep hill before the brewery. Feel free to walk your bike up!

Finally, a reminder of risks and responsibilities. You don’t need to sign a waiver to join Wednesday Night Rides, because it’s an entirely voluntary & free group activity. But please keep in mind:

* Everyone rides at their own risk.
* Every rider is responsible for themselves, their behavior, and their bike.
* Keep your bike properly maintained. Here’s a link to a [basic bike check](https://bikepgh.org/2017/03/09/bike-video-abc-quick-check/).
* Cycling has inherent risks–you could crash, fall down, or get hit by a car, and get hurt or even killed–though we try to minimize these risks.
* If you have a health condition that could affect your ride or put you at additional risk, consider a) checking in with a doctor, b) letting us or a friend know, c) having a backup plan to get home if riding doesn’t work out.
* We always plan to have a sweeper, but can’t rule out that you could get lost, or that your bike could break down and you’ll need to find another way home.

**Want to lead a ride in 2025?** We're looking for ride leaders for August, September, and later in the year. Let us know if you're interested! Our only criteria for leading a ride is that you've joined us before. You don't need to have prior group ride lead experience or come up with the whole route on your own, we can help with that!

Thanks for riding! See you Wednesday.
