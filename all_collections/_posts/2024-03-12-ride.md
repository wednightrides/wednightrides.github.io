Peyton takes us across the Schuylkill FIVE times in our first ride of daylight savings! We’ll be ending at Two Locals, Philly’s first Black-owned brewery! They’re staying open for us past 9pm, so come on out and hang: plenty of bike parking just up the block on 37th!

Please check out our [How We Ride guide](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/) so we keep each other safe! If you're not up for the ride for whatever reason, it's always cool to meet the group at the bar, too.

Specifically, we’d like to call attention to a couple of practices that are really important to how we do our rides to keep us all safe:
 
* Stop at red lights. This may be different from other group rides you have been on in the past—please DO NOT hold car traffic at intersections against the traffic light. If there’s a red light, we stop. Stick with a group big enough to hold the lane, and make friends while waiting for a green light. To avoid anxiety about getting separated, it’s helpful to have as many people as possible using turn-by-turn navigation with RideWithGPS or Komoot.
* Roll past conflict. Sadly, it’s almost inevitable we’ll encounter drivers who are unhappy their commute is interrupted by 30 seconds as a result of our ride. Do what makes sense to avoid and reduce conflict by pulling over, consolidating the group, or whatever makes sense in the situation. Do not swarm, block, or trap cars. Do not engage with aggressive car drivers.
