This week, join the second year of our tour of Philadelphia filming locations for M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, released 26 years ago. While it's always a good idea to look at the route before the ride, [this route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/53079991) is extra informative--it includes details and photos for all of the filming locations. We'll end at Craft Hall on the Delaware River Trail. Halloween costumes are very welcome and encouraged, but not required.

Please take the time to read our [How We Ride guide](/how-we-ride) for our ride practices. Here are a few that are especially important to keep everyone safe:

* We'll be riding on the sidewalk along St Albans Place so we can visit the unique block where Cole's house is located in the film. Please use caution.
* It's not lost on us that the film includes the death of a cyclist. Please ride safely, stop at red lights, and avoid conflict with drivers.
* After dark, PA law requires a headlight and a red tail light or reflector on all bikes.

Finally, a reminder of risks and responsibilities. You don’t need to sign a waiver to join Wednesday Night Rides, because it’s an entirely voluntary & free group activity. But please keep in mind:

* Everyone rides at their own risk.
* Every rider is responsible for themselves, their behavior, and their bike.
* Keep your bike properly maintained. Here’s a link to a [basic bike check](https://bikepgh.org/2017/03/09/bike-video-abc-quick-check/).
* Cycling has inherent risks–you could crash, fall down, or get hit by a car, and get hurt or even killed–though we try to minimize these risks.
* If you have a health condition that could affect your ride or put you at additional risk, consider a) checking in with a doctor, b) letting us or a friend know, c) having a backup plan to get home if riding doesn’t work out.
* We always plan to have a sweeper, but can’t rule out that you could get lost, or that your bike could break down and you’ll need to find another way home.

We're always looking for new folks to lead our rides! Our only criteria for leading a ride is that you've joined us before. You don't need to have prior group ride lead experience or come up with the whole route on your own, we can help with that!

Also, if you've been coming on these rides, we could always use more ride volunteers to help keep everyone safe. Please reach out at info at wednightrides dot org to let us know!

Thanks for riding! See you Wednesday.
