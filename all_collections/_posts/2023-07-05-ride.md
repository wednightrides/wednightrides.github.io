_After being postponed last week due to the citywide Code Red air quality alert, **we're back on for Wednesday July 5**! Come on out for a tour of community gardens ending at Love City._

_Our 'sister ride' [Northwest Night Rides](https://www.instagram.com/nwnightrides/) (that usually rides on the Wednesdays we don't) has graciously scheduled their ride for this week for Sat Jul 8 starting at 6pm. [Check it out](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuNzeZVOGj2/), they're going all the way to Conshohocken Brewing!_

_Note: Apologies for the extra emails this last week. This is typically a low-traffic list aiming for one message every two weeks. The extra messages this week were due to the air quality cancellation and rescheduling, not our switch to a new email platlform._

For this week's ride, our first ride of the summer, we'll be touring community gardens (including [Emily St](https://www.ngtrust.org/growing-home/) & [Iglesias Gardens](https://iglesiasgardens.com/)) and murals about food and water justice (like [this one on Bodine High School](https://www.muralarts.org/artworks/reading-the-flow-and-chainlinkgreen/)) in South & North Philly. 

Our ride leader Melissa is dedicating this ride to her late uncle, who recently passed away from pancreatic cancer. We'll end at Love City, where they're offering happy hour prices for those who wish to [donate to Melissa's cancer research fundraiser](https://profile.pmc.org/MS0448).

A few notes, complementary to our [How We Ride](https://wednightrides.org/how-we-ride/) guide:

* Stay behind the leader of the ride.
* This route includes a few intersections where crossing traffic doesn't have a stop sign (e.g. on Emily and Manton St). Use extra care at those intersections, and look -- don't assume that because the rider in front of you continued, it's safe to do so.
* If you ride with your phone or bike computer mounted on the bike, please [pin or download the route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/43430306) ahead of time and run it in navigation during the ride. The more people who know where we're going, the better!
